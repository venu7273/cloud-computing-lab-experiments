Step 1 - Open Terminal
$ su hduser
Password:
Step 2 - Start dfs and mapreduce services
$ cd /usr/local/hadoop/hadoop-2.7.2/sbin
$ start-dfs.sh
$ start-yarn.sh
$ jps
Step 3 - Check Hadoop through web UI
// Go to browser type http://localhost:8088 – All Applications Hadoop Cluster
// Go to browser type http://localhost:50070 – Hadoop Namenode
Step 4 – Open New Terminal
$ cd Desktop/
$ mkdir inputdata
$ cd inputdata/
$ echo “Hai, Hello, How are you? How is your health?” >> hello.txt
$ cat >> hello.txt
Step 5 – Go back to old Terminal
$ hadoop fs –copyFromLocal /home/hduser/Desktop/inputdata/hello.txt /folder/hduser
// Check in hello.txt in Namenode using Web UI
Step 6 – Download and open eclipse by creating workspace
Create a new java project.
Step 7 – Add jar to the project
You need to remove dependencies by adding jar files in the hadoop source folder. Now Click
on Project tab and go to Properties.Under Libraries tab, click Add External JARs and select all the
jars in the folder (click on 1st jar, and Press Shift and Click on last jat to select all jars in between and
click ok)
/usr/local/hadoop/hadoop-2.7.2/share/hadoop/commonand
/usr/local/hadoop/hadoop-2.7.2/share/hadoop/mapreduce folders.
Step -8 – WordCount Program
Create 3 java files named
● WordCount.java
● WordCountMapper.java
● WordCountReducer.java
Step 9 - Creatr JAR file
Now Click on the Run tab and click Run-Configurations. Click on New Configuration button on the
left-top side and Apply after filling the following properties.
Step 10 - Export JAR file
Now click on File tab and select Export. under Java, select Runnable Jar.
In Launch Config – select the config fie you created in Step 9 (WordCountConfig).
Select an export destination (lets say desktop.)
Under Library handling, select Extract Required Libraries into generated JAR and click
Finish.
Right-Click the jar file, go to Properties and under Permissionstab, Check Allow executing
file as a program. and give Read and Write access to all the users
Step 11 – Go back to old Terminal for Execution of WordCount Program
$hadoop jar wordcount.jar/usr/local/hadoop/input/usr/local/hadoop/output
Step 12 – To view results in old Terminal
$hdfs dfs -cat /usr/local/hadoop/output/part-r-00000
Step 13 - To Remove folders created using hdfs
$ hdfs dfs -rm -R /usr/local/hadoop/output
